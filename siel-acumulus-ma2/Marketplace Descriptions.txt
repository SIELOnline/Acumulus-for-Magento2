Short Description:
The Acumulus module connects your Magento store to the Dutch SIEL Acumulus online financial administration application. 

Long Description:
The Acumulus module connects your Magento store to the Dutch SIEL Acumulus online financial administration application. It can add your invoices automatically or via a batch send form to your administration, saving you a lot of manual, error prone work.
The Acumulus module:
Reacts to order status changes via actions.
Does have 3 admin screens: a settings, advanced settings, and a batch send screen.
Does not in any way interfere with the front-end UI.
The Acumulus module assumes that you have an account with SIEL Acumulus. If not, this module is useless and will not do anything.
