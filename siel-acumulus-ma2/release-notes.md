Release 5.x is the first to work with Magento Marketplace and composer. This means that:

- From now on you install this extension via Magento Marketplace.
- The library common to all supported web shops is downloaded and installed (by composer) as a dependency and can thus also be updated on its own by composer. Note that updates to the library are far more common then updates to the extension.
- The common library part contains an exhaustive changelog. The extension is not likely to change much and therefore, will not contain a separate changelog.
