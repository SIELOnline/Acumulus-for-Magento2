Release 5.0.1 is the first to work with Magento Marketplace and composer. This means that:

- From now on you install this extension via Magento Marketplace.
- The library common to all supported web shops is downloaded and installed (by composer) as a dependency and can thus also be updated on its own by composer. Note that updates to the library are far more common then updates to the extension.
- Exhaustive changelogs are (or will be as of the next version) part of the extension and the library.
